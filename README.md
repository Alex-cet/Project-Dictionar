# Project-Dictionar
Hello! This project was made using HTML, Javascript & CSS! This project is based on creating a dictionary and searching words in it afterwards. The user has to input a word
(any word) in the input box to add it to the dictionary. After entering all of those words, the user can search any word to see if it is in the dictionary or not.
After searching, the user will be able to still add more words which means basically that the program will run infinitely. Enjoy!
